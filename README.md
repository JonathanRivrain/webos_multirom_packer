webos_multirom_packer
=====================

Script to download, edit and pack webOS alpha for MultiROM.

Forked from Tasssadar/webos_multirom_packer to update the variables from http://build.webos-ports.org/
because file names have changed, and I'd like to enable other available builds, like luneos-stable.

Just testing for the moment. Does not not work yet, the init.patch is outdated, needs rewrite.
